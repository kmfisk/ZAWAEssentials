  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_2": "This small parrot is one of many in the Aratinga conure family. Nanday conures are native to the South American pantanal, but pets have escaped and established breeding populations in Florida, California and Texas.

  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_3": "While certain populations have more or less red, no two mitred conures have the same red pattern of feathers on their head. They have so much variation in color that scientists think they might be a species complex: instead of one bird with a lot of variation, they might be several species that are so similar they’re hard to tell apart.",

When a pair of proud parrot parents has a clutch of babies, instead of being on their own, other members of the flock will help out by watching the chicks and bringing them food. This may be because toucans will eat chicks, so keeping a babysitter around keeps them away.",

  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_0": "Not many parrot species are sexually dimorphic, but eclectus are, and boy, are they. They’re also unique because while most birds have a super-bright male and a drabber female, eclectus have a flashy female and muted male. Male and female eclectus parrots are so different that early ornithologists thought they were two different species at first.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_1": "There are lots of subspecies of eclectus, but scientists aren’t quite sure what else they’re closest to. Some bird nerds put them closer to lories and lorikeets, while others think it might be a close cousin of the great-billed parrot. Like many Southeast Asian parrots, eclectus are threatened by habitat loss due to the palm oil and other tropical fruit industries.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_2": "Eclectus parrots are popular pets because of their bright colors, and generally gentle and quiet nature. However, they’re extremely difficult to care for. In the wild, they eat mostly fruit, and have a very long digestive tract to get the most out of fiber and nutrients. A bad diet of seeds and poor-quality pellets can hurt them, and the baseline for abuse in these parrots is very low.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_3": "Anyone who looks at them knows that the two sexes of eclectus look different, but they also have very different personalities. Eclectus hens are ferociously maternal, going broody very easily and ready to bite anyone who tries to remove them from a small, dark space. Males are docile and gentle, or even shy.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_4": "This eclectus parrot is missing blue pigment on some of its body, causing patches of white and yellow feathers. While “pied” birds can be a natural mutation, it’s extra important to make sure they’re well-cared for: yellow feathers can also sprout where a bird’s skin has been damaged from bad nutrition, plucking or abuse. Treasure this special bird, Zookeeper!",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.eclectus_5": "This parrot has no red or yellow pigment in its feathers. If you have a boy, he’s probably a pretty turquoise color, and if you have a girl, she’s got white where her red head and wings would be. This mutation is called “axanthic,” and while it’s pretty, it’s not naturally occurring. A true blue eclectus is super rare, so if your breeder offers a lot of them, it might be showing their ugly true colors.",
