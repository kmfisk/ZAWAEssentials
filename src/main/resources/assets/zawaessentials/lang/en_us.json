  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot": "Large, stocky, short-tailed parrots from Central and South America. Extremely intelligent and long-lived. Threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and some island isolate species threatened by climate change-related extreme weather.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_0": "This unique, beautiful parrot is in a critical condition. Many parrot species are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and agricultural encroachment, and the Imperial amazon is no different, but its primary issue is hurricanes. There are less than 50 of these purple-and-black birds in the wild, and as severe weather increases due to climate change, they will be in even more danger.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_1": "Most amazon parrot species are primarily green, with bright, striped wings and markings on their forehead and cheeks. There are many subspecies of the yellow-fronted amazon, which have yellow patches of feathers covering different areas of their forehead, nape, or even the entire head.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_2": "While the blue-fronted amazon is seeing a wild population decline, it’s had a recent resurgence. Escaped pet parrots in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil are starting to breed and settle in the city, proving that, for better or for worse, parrots are an adaptable species that can learn to live with their circumstances.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_3": "The striking Saint Lucia amazon is the national bird of its native range. Despite its prestigious position, this parrot’s population dropped under 200 in the 1970s: with an outcry of public support, a breeding program was started and doubled the population to 300. Making an animal a symbol can do wonders for its recovery, but it’s important to remember that iconic animals aren’t the only ones that need attention.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_4": "Saint Vincent’s amazon is a unique-looking parrot. Like a lot of other parrots, the Saint Vincent amazon nests in hollow trees. They face an unusual threat: on top of the usual suspects, introduced armadillos dig under, and topple, the old growth forest they need to nest. Invasive species can have unexpected, tragic consequences for native wildlife.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_5": "Surprise, the Cuban amazon parrot is found mostly in Cuba - but according to archaeological evidence, it’s also lived on several surrounding islands, extirpated by human intervention and other unknown means. The Cuban amazon is a popular pet in Russia, after Russian soldiers brought birds back in the 1980s and 1990s.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_6": "The biggest species of amazon, the mealy is a mellow fellow. Unlike other amazon species, which have brightly colored underwings and heads, this huge parrot is entirely green. Mealy amazons are reportedly gentle and easygoing, and even in the wild, often associate with other parrots to forage and gather at mineral licks.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.amazon_parrot_7": "Many species of parrot don’t breed well, both in the wild and in captivity. Yellow-naped amazons have one of the lowest success rates, with less than 10% of eggs hatching and less making it to adulthood, made even worse by the fact that poachers take the young that do hatch.",

  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.australian_ringneck_parrot_0": "Exporting native Australian parrots was banned in 1959, and because of this, many seemingly-common wild species have sparse or genetically bottlenecked populations in captivity. Port Lincoln parrots are one of them, and the few individuals outside of Australia are often hybrids with other ringneck species, or have congenital foot and claw issues.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.australian_ringneck_parrot_1": "The seemingly strange name of this bird describes its three-syllable contact call, which it makes, frequently, to keep in contact with others in its flock. Twenty-eights can be distinguished from the similar Port Lincolns because of their red forehead and yellow belly feathers.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.australian_ringneck_parrot_2": "The mallee parrot is a unique looking bird, with soft, pastel colors that almost look like an oil or watercolor painting. Broad-tailed parrots like the mallee are confrontational and cantankerous, and when annoyed or threatened, wag their tails while making a mechanical-sounding warning call.",

  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.caique_0": "Even though white-bellied caiques grow up to have a peachy pink-orange head, juvenile birds still have a black cap! Baby black and white capped caiques can be hard, if not impossible, to tell apart until their adult head colors come in. There’s no behavioral differences between the two species, and both are bouncy, playful personalities.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.caique_1": "Sometimes called the clowns of the parrot world, caiques are known for being energetic, playful, and wonderfully weird. Unfortunately, they also need a lot of attention, and can get aggressive, destructive, and even start to pull out their own feathers if neglected.

  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_0": "Sun conures are one of the most popular pet birds in the world, but sadly their wild cousins pay the price for popularity: they’re readily poached, both as pet birds and for their colorful feathers. They have a loud, distinct scream that can be heard through miles of forest by their flock mates - as well as by any neighbors or family members, if they are left bored in a house.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_1": "Jenday conures are closely related to sun conures - in fact, they might actually be a subspecies, but scientists haven’t decided yet. They’re more yellow on the face, and have all-green wings instead of rainbow. A hybrid of a jenday conure and sun conure is, adorably, called a “sunday” conure!",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_2": "This small parrot is one of many in the Aratinga conure family. Nanday conures are native to the South American pantanal, but pets have escaped and established breeding populations in Florida, California and Texas. Despite their drastically different colors, they are the closest relative of sun and jenday conures.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_3": "While certain populations have more or less red, no two mitred conures have the same red pattern of feathers on their head. They have so much variation in color that scientists think they might be a species complex: instead of one bird with a lot of variation, they might be several species that are so similar they’re hard to tell apart.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_4": "This rare parrot has a unique system of breeding and chick-rearing. When a pair of proud parrot parents has a clutch of babies, instead of being on their own, other members of the flock will help out by watching the chicks and bringing them food. This may be because toucans will eat chicks, so keeping a babysitter around keeps them away.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.conure_5": "This blue-faced bird was featured in a popular kids’ film in the 1990s, where one journeyed across the country to find the little girl who loved him. While real blue-crowned conures are truly adventurous, they aren’t good pets for kids. Conures can live 30 to 40 years and are loud, messy and need daily attention and toys for their whole lives.",

Many species are sexually dimorphic with significant differences. Threatened by poaching and human political conflict.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.poicephalus_parrot_0": "Parrots like the senegal are fruit and seed eaters, and travel in large flocks to forage together. Unfortunately, they often find human farms delectable, and many species are shot or poisoned to prevent them from raiding crops. Senegal parrots are fond of high-calorie millet and corn, making them a target for agricultural persecution.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.poicephalus_parrot_1": "Poicephalus parrots, like the red-bellied parrot, are described by avian enthusiasts as quiet, gentle but mischievous. Quiet is relative, of course, and all parrots can and will make noise. If you want a quiet pet, or can’t have noise because of your living situation, you shouldn’t get a parrot.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.poicephalus_parrot_2": "Can you tell a male and female Ruppell’s parrot apart? Adult females and juvenile birds have a bright blue vent, or under tail feathers, while males are mostly grey. Sexual dimorphism is common in poicephalus species, but scientists don’t quite know why.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.poicephalus_parrot_3": "Jardine parrots are sometimes called red-fronted parrots. Only adult jardine parrots have their red-orange foreheads and wing markings, and juveniles are only green and black. Jardine parrots live in pairs or small flocks, and while they enjoy company, they’re not as needy as many other parrots.",

While adults are ruby red, young birds are olive green, and look different enough that backyard birders can easily mistake them for a completely different species. Juvenile birds “ripen” from green to red eventually.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.rosella_1": "This colorful rainbow rosella is a common sight at Aussie birdbaths and bird feeders. Contrary to their cheery coloration, rosellas are known to be aggressive and competitive, and may bully smaller (or even larger) birds away from a feeder. They feed in small groups and make their presence known with loud, clicking calls.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.rosella_2": "The Northern rosella has been a scientifically controversial species, and has gone through a lot of names, Latin names, and even familial classifications. Whatever you want to call it, this white-cheeked bird is closely related to the pale-headed and Eastern rosella. Like other rosellas, the Northern is a broad-tailed parrot, meaning it has more, and thicker, tail feathers.",
  "informational_blurb.zawaessentials.rosella_3": "This pretty parrot is a pastel blue and yellow, with the characteristic white cheeks of many rosella species. While native to Australia, and a regular feature in captive aviculture, the pale-headed rosella had a brief stint as an invasive, introduced species in Hawaii. All rosellas on the island died by the early 1900s, however."
